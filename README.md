# Practical Lab 1 - Univariate Linear Regression on the California Housing Prices Dataset
This repository contains the complete code for the Lab1 of Fondations Of Machine Learning Frameworks.

---
# About 
The goal of this lab is to run a linear regression between the median and house value which is the dependent variable with the independent variables like the median income, populations and number of households. The main focus is to identify which feature offers the best predictive power for median house value using linear regression evaluation metrics.
